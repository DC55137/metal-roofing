						<h1>Roof Anchors</h1>
						<p>
							<strong>Roof Anchors</strong> A roof anchor is a device installed on the roof of a building
								that is designed to serve as an anchor point for a fall arrest system.
		
							Clause 9.3.3 of AS 1891.4:2000 requires that permanently installed anchorages are inspected
							and serviced by a competent person every twelve months. Major Council buildings in many municipalities
							will be fitted with roof anchors.
